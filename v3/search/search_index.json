            "text": "1 Overview\n\n\n1.1 Charter \n\n\nTo create a set of data exchange standards that enable companies and organizations to share license and component information (metadata) for software packages and related content with the aim of facilitating license and other policy compliance.\n\n\n1.2 Definition \n\n\nThe Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX\u00ae) specification is a standard format for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with software packages. An SPDX file is associated with a particular software package or set of packages and contains information about it in the SPDX format.\n\n\n1.3 Why is a common format for data exchange needed? \n\n\nCompanies and organizations (collectively \u201cOrganizations\u201d) are widely using and reusing open source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs independently, which may include a manual and/or automated scan of software and identification of associated licenses followed by manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy.\n\n\n1.4 What does this specification cover? \n\n\n1.4.1\n SPDX Document Creation Information: Meta data to associate analysis results with a specific version of the SPDX file and license for use, and provide information on how, when, and by whom the SPDX file was created.\n\n\n1.4.2\n Package Information: Facts that are common properties of the entire package.\n\n\n1.4.3\n File Information: Facts that are specific to each file included in the package.\n\n\n1.4.4\n Snippet Information: Facts that are specific to only a part of a file.\n\n\n1.4.5\n Other Licensing Information Detected: A way to capture information about and refer to licenses that are not on the SPDX License List.\n\n\n1.4.6\n Relationships Between SPDX Elements: Information on how Documents, Packages \n Files relate to each other.\n\n\n1.4.7\n Annotations: Information about when and by whom the SPDX file was reviewed\n\n\n\n\n1.5 What is not covered in the specification? \n\n\n1.5.1\n Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed.\n\n\n1.5.2\n How the data stored in an SPDX file is used by the recipient.\n\n\n1.5.3\n Any identification of any patent(s) which may or may not relate to the package.\n\n\n1.5.4\n Legal interpretation of the licenses or any compliance actions that have been or may need to be taken.\n\n\n1.5.5\n Examples may contain \n...\n which indicate detailed text specific to the SPDX Document\n\n\n1.6 Format Requirements \n\n\n1.6.1\n Must be in a human readable form.\n\n\n1.6.2\n Must be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write.\n\n\n1.6.3\n Must be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness independent of how it was generated (human or tool).\n\n\n1.6.4\n The SPDX file character set must support UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\n1.6.5\n Must permit automated specification syntax validation.\n\n\n1.6.6\n Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be used to represent this information, as can an annotated tag value flat text file.\n\n\n1.6.7\n Interoperability with an annotate \ntag:value\n format and the RDF format will be preserved.\n\n\n1.6.8\n Tags and RDF properties are case sensitive.\n\n\n1.6.9\n Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is to use *.spdx (for \ntag:value\n format) and *-spdx.rdf for RDF format.\n\n\n1.6.10\n The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use \nrdf:about=\"...\"\n to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present.\n\n\n1.7 Conformance \n\n\n1.7.1\n A file can be designated an SPDX document, if it is compliant with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page).\n\n\n1.7.2\n The official copyright notice to be used with any verbatim reproduction and/or distribution of this SPDX Specification 3.0-DRAFT is:\n\n\n\"Official SPDX\u00ae Specification 3.0-DRAFT Copyright \u00a9 2010-2019 Linux Foundation and its Contributors.

The use of snippets is completely optional and it is not manditory for snippets to be identified. See \nsection 5 Snippet Information\n for further details on the fields available to describe snippets.\n\n\n1.9.2\n External Packages can now be refered to in SPDX documents. When there is no SPDX file information available to document the content of these external packages, then the \nfilesAnalyzed\n attribute on a package should be set to false. See \nsection 3.8\n Files Analyzed for more information.\n\n\n1.9.3\n Packages are now able to associate with an \u201cExternal Reference\u201d which allows a Package to reference an external source of additional information, metadata, enumerations, asset identifiers, or downloadable content believed to be relevant to the Package. See: section \n3.21 External Reference\n, \n3.22 External Reference Comment\n and \nAppendix VI: External Repository Identifiers\n for more information.\n\n\n1.9.4\n The \u201cArtifact of Project\u201d fields at the file level are now deprecated, as they can be replaced by a relationship to the more descriptive External Packages.\n\n\n1.9.5\n A new appendix \u201cUsing SPDX short identifiers in Source Files\u201d has been added to document the best practices to refer to the licenses in the SPDX license list that have emerged from the development community.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n\n\n\nRestrictions\n. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n\n\n\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n\nb. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n\nc. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nRepresentations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation on Liability\n. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n\nb. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n\nf. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.",

            "text": "SPDX License Expressions\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOften a single license can be used to represent the licensing terms of a source code or binary file, but there are situations where a single license identifier is not sufficient. A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1 AND BSD-3-Clause).\n\n\nSPDX License Expressions provides a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef-\n[idString]\n; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., \nAND\n, \nOR\n, \nWITH\n and \n+\n). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section.\n\n\nThe exact syntax of license expressions is described below in \nABNF\n.\n\n\nidstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" )\n\n\nlicense-id = \\\nSPDX License List\n>\n\n\nlicense-exception-id = \\\nSPDX License Exceptions\n>\n\n\nlicense-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring)\n\n\nsimple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref\n\n\ncompound-expression = 1*1(simple-expression /\n\n\nsimple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id /\n\n\ncompound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression /\n\n\ncompound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression ) /\n\n\n\"(\" compound-expression \")\" )\n\n\nlicense-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / compound-expression)\n\n\nIn the following sections we describe in more detail \nlicense-expression\n construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern day software.\n\n\nA valid \nlicense-expression\n string consists of either:\n\n\n(i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or\n\n\n(ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators.\n\n\nThere MUST NOT be whitespace between a license-id and any following \n+\n. This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be whitespace on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be whitespace and/or parentheses on either side of the operators \nAND\n and \nOR\n.\n\n\nSimple License Expressions \n\n\nA simple \nlicense-expression\n is composed one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: GPL-2.0\n\n\nAn SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary\"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: GPL-2.0+\n\n\nA SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring)\n\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\nLicenseRef-23\n\nLicenseRef-MIT-Style-1\n\nDocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2\n\n\n\nComposite License Expressions \n\n\nMore expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the \ntag:value\n format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, should be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". This has been specified to facilitate expression parsing. Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in subsection (4).\n\n\n1) Disjunctive \"OR\" Operator\n\n\nIf presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new lincense expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values.\n\n\nFor example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1 or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1 OR MIT)\n\n\n\nAn example representing a choice between three different licenses would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1 OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause)\n\n\n2) Conjunctive \"AND\" Operator\n\n\nIf required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values.\n\n\nFor example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1 or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1 AND MIT)\n\n\n\nAn example where all three different licenses apply would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1 AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause)\n\n\n\n3) Exception \"WITH\" Operator\n\n\nSometimes a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special exception situation. A valid \nlicense-expression\n is where the left operand is a \nsimple-expression\n value and the right operand is a \nlicense-exception-id\n that represents the special exception terms.\n\n\nFor example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0+, the expression would be:\n\n\n(GPL-2.0+ WITH Bison-exception-2.2)\n\n\n\nThe current set of valid exceptions can be found in \nSPDX License Exception List\n. If the applicable exception is not found on the SPDX License Exception List, then use a single \nlicense-ref\n to represent the entire license terms (including the exception).\n\n\n4) Order of Precedence and Parentheses\n\n\nThe order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a \nlicense-expression\n a is:\n\n\n+\nWITH\nAND\nOR\n\n\n\nwhere a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator.\n\n\nFor example, the following expression:\n\n\nLGPL-2.1 OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT\n\n\n\nrepresents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1 and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator.\n\n\nWhen required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a \nlicense-expression\n can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2.\n\n\nFor instance, the following expression:\n\n\n(MIT AND (LGPL-2.1+ OR BSD-3-Clause))\n\n\n\nstates the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1+ or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license.\n\n\n5) License Expressions in RDF \n\n\nA conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a \nspdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet\n element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required.\n\n\nspdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet\n\n    \nspdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0\"/\n\n    \nspdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"\n\n        \nspdx:extractedText\n\n            In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.\n            You will not hold the author liable for all the damage this software will inevitably cause not only\n            to your person and property, but to the entire fabric of the cosmos.\n        \n/spdx:extractedText\n\n        \nspdx:licenseId\nLicenseRef-EternalSurrender\n/spdx:licenseId\n\n    \n/spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo\n\n\n/spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet\n\n\n\n\nA disjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a \nspdx:DisjunctiveLicenseSet\n element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the disjunctive license.
